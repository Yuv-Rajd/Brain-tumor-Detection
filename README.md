    <h1>BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION (Deep Learning)</h1>
    <p>This project focuses on the detection of brain tumors using a deep learning algorithm known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is an academic endeavor that involves the utilization of a CNN to analyze MR images and identify the presence of tumors.</p>
    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Sci-kit learn, Flask, Python</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning-based solution for the detection of brain tumors. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is employed to process MR images and determine whether tumors are present in the scanned images.</p>
    <p>The project uses a dataset sourced from the internet, which consists of MR images that are labeled to indicate the presence or absence of tumors. By training the CNN on this dataset, the model becomes capable of making accurate predictions on new, unseen MR images.</p>
